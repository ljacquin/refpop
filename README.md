## Objective, tasks & analyses, and instructions :

### ðŸŽ¯ Objective

This repository houses ```R``` scripts designed to ensure reproducible data analysis and results, aimed at characterizing the refpop population, according to the FAIR principles defined as follows :

* **F**indable

* **A**ccessible

* **I**nteroperable

* **R**eusable

### ðŸ“Š Tasks & analyses 

#### Overview

The refpop scripts aim to automate at their best the following tasks and analyses :

* **Phenotype outlier detection**: Intended to automatically produce a clean phenotype dataset, i.e., one that is free of outliers, using robust multivariate and knowledge-based rule methods

* **Spatial heterogeneity correction**: Aims to address spatial heterogeneity for each trait in the cleaned phenotype dataset, and then identify environments with low heritability using a robust univariate outlier detection method and exclude these for further analysis. For each trait, heritability distributions across all environments are computed before and after spatial heterogeneity correction; these distributions are also computed by management type

* **Adjusted ls-means computation**: Focuses on computing the adjusted phenotypic ls-means for each genotype across environments, using the adjusted phenotypes obtained from spatial heterogeneity correction in each environment

* **Data structure inference**: Focuses on inferring the genomic, phenotypic, and pedigree data structures of the refpop population

* **Genomic prediction accuracy evaluation**: Seeks to evaluate, for each trait, the genomic prediction accuracy for the adjusted phenotypic ls-means based on the genomic data

* **G x E x M evaluation**: Directed towards evaluating, for each trait, the interactions between genotypes, their environments and management types

#### Details

Three main folders in the ```refpop``` repository are central to the tasks and analyses performed by the refpop ```R``` scripts:

* ```src```: Houses the ```R``` scripts

* ```data```: Contains the data sourced, processed and analyzed by the ```R``` scripts. Note that some processed data, such as the clean phenotype dataset for example, are written and stored in this folder

* ```results```: Stores the results generated by the ```R``` script tasks and analyses

Furthermore, the ```src``` contains several folders: ```refpop_data_structure_analysis```, ```refpop_data_treatment_and_analysis```, etc., according to the type of tasks and analysis performed by the user, e.g. general purpose data treatment and analyses such as outlier identification & removal, spatial heterogeneity correction, etc., or more specific task such as genomic prediction modeling and analysis.
